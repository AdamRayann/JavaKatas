# Java Katas

Kata is a Japanese word (型 or 形) meaning "form".
It refers to a detailed choreographed pattern of martial arts movements made to be practiced alone.

Java Katas are short, focused coding exercises designed for practice, aimed at improving specific programming skills, often involving solving problems or implementing algorithms.

## Getting started

1. **Fork** this repo, clone your forked repo and open in your preferred IDE (e.g. IntelliJ).
2. Answer the exercises under `src/main/java/katas/exercises`.
3. Write a corresponding unittest in `src/test/java/katas/exercises`. The unittest test class must be named as `[name of kata]Test.java`.
   For example, for the `HelloWorld.java` kata, the corresponding unittest must be `HelloWorldTest.java`.
4. You can run a single test class by `mvn test -Dtest=[test class name]` (change `[test class name]` accordingly).
5. Commit and push your solutions. In you GitHub repo page, go to **Actions** and make sure you pass the automated test.
